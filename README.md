# 4-Pong
Originally used game of Pong with modifications. Created AI to locate and follow the ball. 
The overall objective is to gain as many points as possible until the win condition, in this case 3. 
To win points, you try to catch the ball instead of reflecting the ball. The ball moves faster than normal and the first person to catch 3 balls wins. 

Modifications:
  1. 4 players instead of 2 players
  2. User vs 3 AI players
